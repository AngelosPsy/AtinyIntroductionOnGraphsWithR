## How to draw graphs with R

As a teaching assistant for the course 'Scientific Writing and Presenting' taught by Dr. Wagenmakers, I wrote a tutorial on how to make simple graphs with R. Since then, I keep revising that tutorial in order to make sure that people with no prior knowledge of R are able to follow the text from cover to cover. Thus, in case you want me to include something more in it, or in case you want to provide any sort of feedback, please feel free to communicate with me.
